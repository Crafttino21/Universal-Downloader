# Universal-Downloader
A Python-based converter for some stuff, I wanna add some new functions later. The program can download pictures from Google and YouTube Videos Everything is Ad-Free, I dont like paid or Ad-Infected stuff.

**New to version 1.3**
* Mayor Bug fixes
* Crash-on-Download Fix
* fix for a shitty error message by the requests libary which is Enoing but have no Consequents for the code
P.S look Below for the feature of MultiDownloader!!


**New to version 1.2.2 (Patched)**
* Used while True instead of while option != 0 to simplify the loop.
* Used input() instead of int(input()) to handle non-integer input gracefully.
* Used option.lower() to convert the input option to lowercase and simplify the if statements.
* Removed the exit() calls in the try-except blocks and used continue instead to keep the loop running.
* Added better exit() mechanic with sys.exit() which passing a 1 means an error occured.
* Added a prompt for the destination directory in option 3.
* Moved the menu() call outside the function to prevent an infinite recursion loop.

**Version 1.2 Functions**
 - Download YouTube videos as MP4
 - Download pictures from any site and Google with the picture source
 - Download YouTube MP3

**Planed feature for MultiDownloader**
* Add a Torrent function
* add Tiktok Options
* add Reddit options
* add Spotify options
* give evrything a GUi outside of the Command line (Maybe)
  Spaical thank's to Cozi to help me Fixing bugs and make the code cleaner :)
